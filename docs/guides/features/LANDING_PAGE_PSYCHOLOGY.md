## 📊 Section Flow & Psychology

### **Stage 1: ATTENTION** (Get them to stop scrolling)

    ↓
Hero section immediately visible
    ↓

## 🚀 Key Conversion Secrets

### Secret #1: The Rule of 3
- 3 testimonials (not 10 - more feels fake)
- 3 CTA options (not 1 - gives choice)
- 3-4 benefit categories (sweet spot)

### Secret #2: Strategic Repetition
- CTA appears: Hero, Demo, Secondary, Risk Reversal = 4x
- Message reinforces after each objection removal
- Repetition without being annoying

### Secret #3: Progress Visualization
- Progress bar in calculator
- Numbered steps in demo
- Categories in FAQ
- Visual sense of advancement builds momentum

### Secret #4: The Frequency Illusion
- Specific numbers (50,000 not "thousands")
- Real names (Sarah Chen not "a student")
- Real results ($40K not "money")
- Specificity = believability = conversion

### Secret #5: The Micro-Decision Loop
- Each section = small decision
- Small decisions lead to big decision
- By time they reach Risk Reversal, they've decided mentally
- Final CTA is just confirmation
